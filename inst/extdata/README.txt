We're not bundling the Lindo et al data with this archive, but if we were
we'd have left it here.  In virtue of leaving this text file here, installing the
R package will create an extdata subdirectory of the lrd package directory.
By downloading [Lindo et al's replication materials](https://www.aeaweb.org/aej/app/data/2008-0202_data.zip)
and unzipping them into that subdirectory one can replicate what we would have
provided had we bundled their replication materials with ours.
