Problem: _net of the running variable_ $R$ (college year 1 grade avg. or GPA), what's $Z \equiv \mathcal{I}[R<0]$'s effect on $Y$ (year 2 GPA)?  

(A _regression discontinuity_ estimate of academic probation's impact.) 

<div class="notes">

- A study of academic probation within a Canadian university system
- Assignment to treatment vs control determined by position of "running variable" relative to threshold value.
- Regression discontinuity designs collect data of this broad structure, look for a discontinuity at threshold...
- as we appear to see here.  What does it mean to call this the causal effect of AP?

## Regression discontinuity designs | (RDDs): Three causal interpretations {.smaller}

> - Traditional view [@thistlethwaite1960regression]: Assume $Y = \alpha + \tau Z + \beta R + \epsilon$, $\epsilon \perp R$.  The causal effect is $\tau$. 
> - Limit-based view [@hahn2001iae; @imbens2008regression]:  Perhaps $E(Y|R, Z)$ is linear, perhaps not; causal effect is $\lim_{r\uparrow 0} E(Y|R=r) - \lim_{r\downarrow 0} E(Y|R=r) =: \tau$.
> - Potential outcomes view [@lee2008randomized; @cattaneo2014randomization;@matteiMealliObsStud]: causal effects are quantities like $E [Y_T - Y_C]=:\tau$, whatever the form of $E[Y|R]$; just as these average causal effects are nonparametrically identified in randomized trials, "local randomization" suffices in RDDs. 
>- We [@lrdauthors:main] offer a distinct intepretation of local randomization in terms of potential outcomes. It squares better with the concept of Thistlethwaite & Campbell, and with common patterns in RDD data.

<div class="notes">
- It's one thing to say "there was natural randomization," another to assert that every treatment assignment was random in this way. 
- To address this challenge, methodologists have proposed preliminary specification tests, and procedures built on specification tests.
- I'll review 2 of the most common tests and procedures before arguing that they aren't quite up to the task.

## $X$es should look "locally randomized" {.smaller}

> - Local randomization should be reflected in covariates, e.g. prior $G$rades ($y$ axis). 
> - Due to trend, clear that $G \not\perp Z (\equiv \mathcal{I}[R\leq 0])$.
($G$ is not "balanced" vis a vis $Z$.)<!-- Does the `\not` come thru? -->
> - Recent "local randomization" proposals confine attention to $\{R \in \mathcal{W}\}$, $\mathcal{W}$ narrow enough that $H: G \perp Z \vert \{R \in \mathcal{W}\}$ is not rejected.
> - Our loc. rand. proposal first models trend, e.g. $G \approx \alpha_G + \beta_G R$, then tests $H': e_{(\alpha_G, \beta_G)}(G|R) \perp Z \vert \{R \in \mathcal{W}\}$. ($G$'s _residual_ is balanced.)

<div class="notes">

- In general, $H'$ is sustainable with wider $\mathcal{W}$ than $H$. (Don't throw away good data!)
- In Lindo et al dataset, permutation tests comparing $X$es above and below 0 reject for windows w/ half-width $> .3$
- The window we considered had half-width $.5$.  Removing linear trend, its residuals are perfectly balanced.

## Local randomization & the density of $R$ | the McCrary [-@mccrary2008manipulation] test

<div class="columns-2">


>  - Purpose of test: expose whether subjects secured or avoided treatment by manipulating their $R$s.
>  - If so, then density of $R$ differs on either side of cutpoint.
<!--
>  - Pick narrow $\tilde{\mathcal{W}} \subseteq \mathcal{W}$, test $\tilde{H}: \log \big[\frac{d}{dt} \mathrm{Pr}(R \leq t)\big]_{t=R} \perp \mathcal{I}[R\leq 0] | \{R \in \tilde{\mathcal{W}}\}.$ 
-->
>  - Canadian colleges data have a clump at $R=0$. McCrary throws a red flag!

</div>

> - To avoid rejecting $\tilde{H}$, $\mathcal{W} \mapsto \mathcal{W}\setminus \{0\}$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{W}} \mapsto \tilde{\mathcal{W}}\setminus \{0\}$. (Carve hole in middle, leaving a "donut.")

<div class="notes">

- The widely used McCrary test checks for equal density of R immediately to either side of the cutpoint 
- no-manipulation hypothesis is rejected, due to chunk of students avoiding AP by falling exactly on top of the cutpoint
- Removing that chunk and that chunk only gets us a pass on this test.  
<!-- - thinking of this block of students as analogous to attriters in an RCT, this is differential attrition.  -->

## Methods for picking out RCTs within RDDs

> Q: I think I'm seeing naturally occurring random assignment in the vicinity of my regression discontinuity, but it's hard to isolate the subjects whose assignment can be regarded as haphazard.  Can methods help?

> A: To separate unwanted chaff from locally randomized wheat, use specification tests. These tests probe "ignorability" of covariate residuals --- not covariates themselves --- and of the density of the running variable.
> Remedies for test failure may involve reducing the sample.  Deciding which observations to get rid of is an inexact science.
