Title: Limitless regression discontinuity

Abstract:

In a regression discontinuity design (RDD), assignment to treatment
versus a control condition is determined by the value of a particular
baseline variable, $R$. In one recent RDD, $R$ is the average of a
student's grades in his first year at university, while the treatment
condition is academic probation, forced upon a student if his $R$
falls below a threshold.  The RDD setup can also be used to estimate
deaths attributable to a natural disaster, for example Hurricane
Maria, by contrast of mortality series before and after the catastrophic event.

Classical analysis of RDDs parametrically models outcomes as linear in
$R$ and the intervention variable, using ordinary least squares to
estimate the slope, intercept and intervention effect.  Some recent
RDD methods relax linearity assumptions by
contrasting limits of $E(Y|R=r)$ as $r$ approaches a
cut-point, $c$, from either side; others avoid passing to limits by
supposing that falling to the left or the right of the threshold is
essentially random, conditionally upon falling close to the threshold.
Each of these approaches turns out to be difficult to reconcile with
the academic probation and Hurricane Maria examples.

Limitless regression discontinuity relaxes assumptions of classical
regression discontinuity analysis in a somewhat different manner,
involving potential outcomes but also integrating concepts and methods 
from robust statistics. The method is equally comfortable with discrete and
continuous running variables.  It is uniquely equipped to meet the
significant, somewhat misunderstood threat indicated by failure of
McCrary's test. In combination with polynomial specifications, it
dramatically improves the classical method, reducing RMSE
by factors upwards of 100. It is straightforward to implement in R and Stata.

This is joint work with Adam C. Sales, University of Texas-Austin.
