##  Data analysis

 Regarding academic probation at the 3 Canadian universities, MM estimation w/ bisquare psi tells a different story than local randomization methods without detrending, but a similar story to a common limit-based method.
 
|                  |Estimate |95\% CI     |$\mathcal{W}$ |n     |
|:-----------------|:--------|:-----------|:-------------|-----:|
|Limitless         |0.24     |(0.17,0.31) |[0.01,0.50)   | 10000|
|Local Permutation |0.11     |(0.05,0.17) |[0.01,0.18)   |  3400|
|Local OLS         |0.23     |(0.19,0.28) |[0.01,1.24)   | 26000|

- "Local OLS" method targets a difference of limits.  That, other diff's
  from our method didn't change much in this case. (The McCrary test
  finding says contamination could have occurred, not that it did.)
-  "Local Permutation" fails to adjust for the running variable, explaining both:
its very narrow $\mathcal{W}$, and consequent loss of power; its discrepant estimate, as a result of residual bias from the running variable.

- Permutation (Cattaneo et al '14) shows inadmissible bias, undercoverage.
- Limitless, Local OLS use a well-specified $E(Y_C | R)$ model. They cover well, w/ little bias.
- Limitless's CIs narrower with heavier-tailed effects ($Y_{Ti}-Y_{Ci}$) and/or errors ($Y_i-E(Y | R)$). 



## Are the answers any different?

> Q: Does bounded influence regression (following testing and adjustment of $\mathcal{W}$) give answers that are any different than RDD methods already in use?

> A: Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Differences are more likely with heavy tailed errors, which give the robust method a heavy efficiency advantage. When differences occur, diagnostics show you why, and are likely to impugn the other method.
