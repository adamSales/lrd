## Simulation {.build .smaller}

- Each method mildly anti-conservative for small $n$.  
- Only limitless, local OLS improve as $n$ increases.

- Under Normal errors, limitless and local OLS are similarly powered.
- Under $t_3$ errors, limitless has much more power.

##  Data analysis

 Regarding academic probation at the 3 Canadian universities, MM estimation w/ bisquare psi tells a different story than local randomization methods without detrending, but a similar story to a common limit-based method.
 
|                  |Estimate |95\% CI     |$\mathcal{W}$ |n     |
|:-----------------|:--------|:-----------|:-------------|-----:|
|Limitless         |0.24     |(0.17,0.31) |[0.01,0.50)  | 10000|
|Local Permutation |0.11     |(0.05,0.17) |[0.01,0.18)   |  3400|
|Local OLS         |0.23     |(0.19,0.28) |[0.01,1.24)   | 26000| 

 
 
## The robustness weights diagnostic {.build}

- Robust regression fitting generates "robustness" weights $\in [0,1]$, showing which observations the fitter deemed to be anomalous.
- If $\mathcal{W}$ is still too wide, or its donut hole isn't wide enough, plot of robustness weights against $R$ gives an additional shot at detection.

<!--  (To assign 0's to truly anomalous observations, not just any robust method will do; you need bounded influence regression.)-->


## Are the answers any different?

> Q: Does bounded influence regression (following testing and adjustment of $\mathcal{W}$) give answers that are any different than RDD methods already in use?

> A: Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Differences are more likely with heavy tailed errors, which give the robust method a heavy efficiency advantage. When differences occur, diagnostics show you why, and are likely to impugn the other method.
