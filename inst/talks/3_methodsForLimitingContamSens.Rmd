## Sensitivity to clumps of bad data {.build .smaller}

Say there are "savvy" students who, when at risk for AP, "manipulate" grades $\uparrow$. (Bribes?)   
This latent subgroup is overrepresented in excised donut hole $\{i: z_i=0\}$, but may be elsewhere too. As many as $O(n^{1/2})$ "bad" points remain, undercutting estimation of $E(Y_C | R)$. 

How does this affect $\hat\tau$? --- A _contamination sensitivity_ problem, if not recognized as such in RDD literature.

- At right, molecular design example discussed in _Robust Statistics_ text.  Not an RDD, but the lines that I've added treat it as though it were, with threshold right in the middle of the plot.
- Think of rightmost 3 points as a contaminating latent subgroup.  Large effect on OLS, less on robust method.
- If the latent subgroup is both different and large, we ought to be able to find it in tests. OW we're in domain of "$\epsilon$ contamination"...
- OLS handles $\epsilon$ contamination poorly. Methods that handle it better explore the sample systematically to find small subsets of points the exclusion of which changes the answer, then downweight these, sometimes to 0.

## Robust MM estimates of regression | a high-level review {.build}

- Robust regression substitutes out OLS' $e_{(a,b)}(y|r) = y-a-br$ with $e_{(a,b,s)}(y|r) = \psi\{(y - a -br)/s\}$, some $\psi(\cdot)$, $s(\cdot)$.
- After much study, robustness literature identified pairs $(\psi, s)$ that handle groups of outliers while retaining $\sqrt{n}$ rates, efficiency.
- E.g., "MM with bisquare psi-function and robust scale",...
- In R, `robustbase::lmrob`; in Stata, `mmregress`.
- <!-- Asymptotically,--> To limit sensitivity to contamination of a $O(n^{-1/2})$ share of the sample --- the smallest contamination share you can expect specification testing to detect --- OLS won't do. Need robust MM regression [@he1991localbreakdown; @yohaiZamar1997locallyrobustMestimates].


## Methods for limiting contamination sensitivity

> Q: Tests and adjustments may have gotten rid of the better part of the sample that didn't belong, but maybe they didn't remove every last bit of contamination.  Is there a sensitivity analysis method that addresses this issue?


> A: With RDDs, there's a better option than post hoc sensitivity analysis.  You can address sensitivity to contamination (as opposed to omitted variable sensitivity) as a part of the primary analysis, with the help of robust MM estimators.  While less familiar in social science, these methods are efficient, easy to use and readily available in R and Stata.
