Adam's close edit

- added $\ge 9$ to sum formula for total death toll (p. 4). even though we
  previously defined tau_i for only months 9-12, that might escape
  notice of the casual reader who will then wonder why all 12 tau's
  should be included in the death toll.

- we don't actually ever estimate the total death toll do we? (p. 4)
  AS made minimal revision: change "offer an RDD estimate" -> "discuss RDD
  estimation"

- oxford commas? I'm in favor--adding them in when I see them missing

- p. 7, "target of estimation" as the ATE. we previously said the
  target was the total effect, \sum \tau_i. change here?

- title of sec. 2: Review of Selected Methods-> Review of Selected RDD
  Methods

- I also re-wrote the 2-sentence intro to Sec. 2

- I put something in the beginning of Sec. 2 about setting c=0, since
  that's how we talk about stuff for the rest of the paper.

- in intro to Sec. 2, potential outcomes and z_i are lower-case. Is
  this right? are we consistant?

- top of p. 10. (2.1) sentence: " that is, the tau estimate from an OLS fit
  of the variant of (3) with dependent variable yH." This isn't
  obvious--we never define alpha hat and beta hat, and why should (4)
  be equal to tau? Revised a bit.

- end of 2.1.1: I re-wrote the sentence comparing CIs from inversion
  of hypothesis tests to Wald-type CIs. Mostly stylistic. "Partial
  compliance"->"imperfect compliance" cuz "partial compliance" means
  that D is strictly between 0 and 1. New formulation a bit less
  precise, cuz doesn't state what is meant by "better" coverage, but
  I think it's more readable.

- beginning of 2.2: took out "or robust" since we don't discuss robust
  fitters til later.

- 2.2.3: took out H_b, \alpha_M, p_{j} which we never actually
  define. Restated without extra notation.

- 2.2.4: removed \vec{} notation, as Dan asked. Instead bolded
  stuff. Also bolded \beta, and defined as a vector of
  coefficients. Also see 3.3.

-3.1 fixed section reference pointing to the wrong place

-3.1 S-ancillary -> ancillary, as in 1.2

- 3.3 replaced \vec{} with \bm{}, as Dan asked. I also made \beta and 0
  bold. I put ^T on the x_i's, so that now they are column vectors
  instead of row-vectors. I figure that's what people typically
  expect.

-3.5 "bounded influence regression"-> "robust MM regression" + a
 couple other grammatical edits.

- sec 4. put 2 figures at the beginning of their subsections, to fix
  weird wrapfigure behavior.

- Figure 2 caption edited for brevity

- 4.2 rounded effect estimate to 2 decimal places, instead of 3

- 5.1 fixed description of distribution of $\eta$
