Dear Dan,

Thanks for arranging three informative reviews of our "Limitless
Regression Discontinuity" manuscript (JEBS-2018-MAN-0075), and for
adding your own well-considered comments to theirs.  We appreciate
this opportunity to revise in light of these critiques. We hope you'll
agree that our doing so has not only addressed the reviewers' concerns
but also significantly improved the paper.

We were led to consider adding an additional example by the
combination of your concerns about accessibility (in particular to
readers "not primarily working on theoretical developments") and
Reviewer 1's suggestion that the paper explore connections to the
"rebar" method of Sales, et al. (2018) published in JEBS. We had identified such an example in the mortality series
surrounding Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, an engaging application
that happens to be well suited structurally to demonstrate one key
idea of our approach through a simplified version of the method
utilizing aspects of rebar.  This revision of the paper expands the
introduction to include the Maria example. This expansion serves
purposes of separating the introduction of our "residual ignorability"
assumption from issues of bandwidth selection, robust regression and
score testing; of more sharply and simply distinguishing our method
from other "local randomization" based methods to appear in recent
literature; and of offering readers a readily visualized example
demonstrating residual ignorability's greater plausibility for
regression discontinuity designs than those methods' core assumptions.

In adding it we also took the opportunity to streamline and reduce the
density of section 2 of our paper, by relocating our discussion of
Fisherian conditioning in causal inference to these new sections of
the introduction. In contrast to our initial submission, in this
version the material that remains in Section 2 (now title "Review of
selected RDD methods") is all background material, and all feeds
directly into our development of the limitless regression
discontinuity method, helping to address your comment that
"the formal development of randomization inference in Section 2 [was]
useful but the distinction of the purely background material from the
development that was [of] specific importance to your innovations was
not sufficiently clear." In particular, we rewrote and relocated our
discussion of the role of robust regression to the following section
(Section 3, "Randomness and Regression in RDDs"),
which presents the paper's main methodological contributions. Moving
and re-writing the material related to robust regression also
addresses your comment that our discussion of MM estimation did not
sufficiently "MM estimation .... is introduced in the middle of a
paragraph with an introductory sentence that does not signal ...  a
key innovation. Moreover the language seems offhand as
if this is a method that could be considered but not one that is being
recommended."

Finally, in response to your comment that "the paper needs to be
revised with a goal of making its methodological contributions clearer
and being more accessible to readers," and similar comments from Reviewers 1 and 3,
we asked a professional editor at one of our institutions to edit our final document for grammar and for style.

We have included specific responses to your other comments, as well as
those of the referees, in a separate document. We are in the process of cleaning up the code underlying our analysis so that it can be made public on github.com; we expect it will be ready on May 1. We are grateful for
your insightful suggestions and those of the reviewers, as well as for
the opportunity to revise the paper. We look forward to your comments
on the revision.
