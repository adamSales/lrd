Many modern analyses of regression discontinuity studies contrast
the limits of a regression as the independent variable, $R$, approaches
a cut-point, $c$, from either side. Other methods require that
assignment to treatment conditions, $\indicator{R<c}$, be ignorable
vis a vis the potential outcomes.

Instead, the method presented in this paper assumes Residual Ignorability,
ignorability of treatment assignment vis a vis detrended potential
outcomes.  Detrending is effected not with ordinary least squares but by MM-estimation,
following a distinct phase of sample decontamination.  Its inferences
acknowledge uncertainty in both of these adjustments, despite its
applicability with either a discrete or a continuous running variable; it
is uniquely robust to leading validity threats facing regression
discontinuity designs.
