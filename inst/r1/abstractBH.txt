One prominent mode of regression discontinuity analysis contrasts a univariate regressionâ€™s limits as its independent variable, $R$, approaches a cut-point, $c$, from either side.  Other recently proposed methods assume assignment to treatment conditions, $\indicator{R<c}$, to be ignorable vis a vis potential outcomes.

Instead, the method presented in this paper assumes Residual Ignorability,
ignorability of treatment assignment vis a vis detrended potential
outcomes.  Detrending is effected not with ordinary least squares but by MM-estimation,
following a distinct phase of sample decontamination.  Its inferences
acknowledge uncertainty in both of these adjustments, despite its
applicability with either a discrete or a continuous running variable; it
is uniquely robust to leading validity threats facing regression
discontinuity designs.
