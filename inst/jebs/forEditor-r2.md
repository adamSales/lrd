Notational adjustments addressing your and reviewer 3's comments:
- On p.16L37-38, we had attached the plural "s" to two symbols involving
  subscripts, and reviewer 3 had read these plural s-es as additional
  subscripts. To disambiguate, this version puts apostrophes between
  those symbols and their modifying s-es. We are of course happy to accept
  direction from you or your assistants about how best to address this 
  typographical issue in a manner most consistent with the journal's style. 
- We've removed the undefined and potentially confusing symbol $\alpha_B$.
