On \textbf{p.~11}, please insert the following just before the
sentence beginning ``Conditioning on the full
   data vector'':
   \begin{quote}
     ($D_C$s are omitted because of our assumption $D_C\equiv 0$; see Section 2.1.1.)
   \end{quote}
Later in the same paragraph, boldface should be added to the ``$A$''
in $A^{*}$.  That is, 
\begin{quote}
  the variables comprising $\mathbf{A}$ are jointly ancillary, just as
  $A^{*}$ was seen to be in Section~1.2
\end{quote}
should become
\begin{quote}
  the variables comprising $\mathbf{A}$ are jointly ancillary, just as
  $\mathbf{A}^{*}$ was seen to be in Section~1.2  
\end{quote}
On \textbf{p.~14}, the displayed equation  
\begin{equation*} %\label{eq:concl1}
\EE \big\{\dt[\thetaInf]{Y_T-D_T\tau_0}{ R } \big| R \big\}
\equiv \EE \big\{ \dt[\thetaInf]{Y_{C}}{ R } \big| R \big\},
\end{equation*}
should become 
\begin{equation*} %\label{eq:concl1}
\EE \big\{\dt[\thetaInf]{Y_T-D_T\tau_0}{ R } \big| Z=1, R \in \mathcal{W}\big\}
\equiv \EE \big\{ \dt[\thetaInf]{Y_{C}}{ R } \big| R \in \mathcal{W} \big\},
\end{equation*}
.\\

On \textbf{p.~23}, please make the following additions or changes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``(of $(D_C, D_T)$)'' should become ``(of $(D_C, D_T)$; see
  Section 2.1.1)''.
\item ``where $(\theta, \eta)$ denotes the full parameter, and $w =
({y},d,r)$ must satisfy'' should become ``where $(\theta, \eta)$
denotes the full parameter and $w = ({y},d,r)$, must satisfy''.
\item ``each solution of $\EE[\IC{W}{(\theta, \eta)}] =0$ makes''
  should become ``each $(\theta, \eta)$ solving $\EE[\IC{W}{(\theta, \eta)}] =0$
  makes''. 
\end{enumerate}

On \textbf{p.~24}, please replace phrase
   ``$\Psi_1$s $z$ factor has been centered on $p_z$''  with ``the factor of $\Psi_1$ involving $z$,
   $f_1(r) = z - p_{z}$, has been centered on $p_z$.''

On \textbf{p.~26}, please insert spaces on the right side of the
inline equation involving $\vec{f}(\cdot)$.  In the proofs it appears
as ``$\vec{f}(\cdot) = [f_{0}(\cdot) f_{1}(\cdot) \ldots
f_{k}(\cdot)]$''; wexo're asking that it instead be
``$\vec{f}(\cdot)=[f_{0}(\cdot)\, f_{1}(\cdot)\, \ldots\,
f_{k}(\cdot)]$'', i.e. that spaces be added to the left and the right
of ``$f_{1}(\cdot)$'' as well as to the left of ``$f_{k}(\cdot)$''.

\newpage
One can have
$$\dt[\thetaInf]{Y_{C}}{ R }%\mathbf{\Ych}_{C}
\independent {Z}| \{R \in \mathcal{W}\}$$
without having 
$$\dt[\thetaInf]{Y_{T} - \tau_{0}D_{T}}{ R }%\mathbf{\Ych}_{C}
\independent {Z}| \{R \in \mathcal{W}\} .$$
(That's particularly easy when the treatment effect non-additive and
also associated with $R$!) As a result, in such circumstances 
$$ \EE \big\{\dt[\thetaInf]{Y_T-D_T\tau_0}{ R } \big| Z=1, R \in
\mathcal{W}\big\} \neq \EE \big\{\dt[\thetaInf]{Y_T-D_T\tau_0}{ R }
\big| R \in \mathcal{W}\big\}$$
and the relationship implicitly defining $\tau_{0}$, 
$$ \EE \big\{\dt[\thetaInf]{Y_T-D_T\tau_0}{ R } \big| Z=1, R \in \mathcal{W}\big\}
\equiv \EE \big\{ \dt[\thetaInf]{Y_{C}}{ R } \big| R \in \mathcal{W} \big\},$$
\textbf{does not} also implicitly define an average treatment effect,
complier average treatment effect or any such quantity.
