Queries:

AQ1: Please replace the keywords with the following list:
causal inference; randomization inference; robust statistics; MM
estimation; contamination sensitivity; higher education

AQ2-AQ3: The formatting is fine as it is. However, we
intended that assumptions be formatted in the same manner that the
title of a theorem or proposition would be formatted.

AQ4: MM and SM are not abbreviations, so they should be left as
is. Please replace "CACE" on the top of page 14 with "TOTE" (which was
previously spelled out).

AQ5: These are correct

AQ6: Please remove this reference

AQ7: These edits are correct

AQ8: The full citation is:
Imbens, G., & Wager, S. (2019). Optimized regression discontinuity
designs. Review of Economics and Statistics, 101(2), 264-278.

AQ9: This is a citation to an online supplement to Lin, W. (2013a). It
can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1214/12-AOAS583SUPP

AQ10: These edits are correct

AQ11:
For Adam C Sales:
"His research interests include principal stratification, machine
learning, and causal inference methods incorporating administrative or
computer log data."

For Ben B Hansen:
"His research interests include matching, sensitivity analysis and
distribution-free methods for observational studies and experiments,
and applications in education and health." 


Other edits:

- p. 3: Please remove the word "authoritative" from the fifth line of text.

- p. 3: Please add the following text in parentheses just before the
  sentence beginning "This section demonstrates..." on the 7th line of
  text:
  "(Rivera and Rolke's [2018] and Acosta and Irizarry's [2018]
  estimates also well exceeded the official count.)"

  The modified text should read:
  "... those that would have occurred otherwise. (Rivera and Rolke's
  [2018] and Acosta and Irizarry's [2018] estimates also well exceeded
  the official count.) This section demonstrates..."

- Please add the following to the citation list:

  Rivera, R., & Rolke, W. (2018). Estimating the death toll of
  Hurricane Maria. Significance, 15(1), 8-9.

  Statistics Expose Fragility of Puerto Rico's Health System. BioRxiv Preprint,
  https://doi.org/10.1101/407874.

- p. 5: Please remove the word "assumption" and the parentheses around
  "Equation 2" from the first line of text, so that it reads:
  "...our method in the general case (Section 3.1), Equation 2 is
  residual ignorability, ...

- p. 5: In the sentence beginning "The null distribution of..." please
  replace the phrase
  	"of a Size 4, without-replacement sample from"
  with
        "of a without-replacement sample of size 4 from"

- p. 6: In the sentence beginning "For simplicity assume, ...," please
  remove the comma after "assume" so that it reads:
  "For simplicity assume noninterference, the model..."

- p. 10: Please change the ending of Section 2.2.4's next-to-last
  sentence from "such as plots of Cook and Weisberg's (1982)
  distances" to "such as plots of Cook's distances (Cook and Weisberg, 1982)"

- p. 11: In the sentence beginning "Uncoupled to...," the 'A' in the
  notation "A*" should be bold, not italicized, as it is on page 5.

- p. 12: Please remove the comma after "However" in the last sentence
  on the page, so that it reads:
  "However b and W are selected, at least..."

- p. 28. Please replace the "Acknowledgements" text to the following:

"The authors thank Susan Dynarski, Xinzhou Guo, Xuming He, Guido
Imbens, Brian Junker, Justin McCrary, Walter Mebane, Kerby Shedden,
Jeff Smith, Rocio Titiunik, the participants in the University of
Michigan Causal Inference in Education Research Seminar, and three
anonymous reviewers for helpful suggestions. They also thank Jeffrey
Howard and Alexis Santos-Lozada for sharing nonpublic research
replication materials and John E. Bellquist for editing." 

- p. 28, note 3. Same as the note to p. 11. The 'A' of "A*" should be
  bold, not italicized, in both cases.


Questions:

- p. 7: Should "[4]" read "Equation 4?" 

- p. 16 & 22: Should "section sign" for Section 5 was not replaced by
  the word "Section" as in the rest of the manuscript. (On page 16 it
  is in the sentence beginning "This specification..." and on page 22
  it is in the sentence beginning "The method of Cattaneo...")
